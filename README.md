# Denshi - A prototype Synchtube bot

## Requirements
- Denshi was developed using Python 2.6.6

## Usage
<pre>
  git clone git://github.com/Falaina/Denshi.git
  cd Denshi
  python denshi.py
</pre>

Edit the included `denshi.conf` file to control the settings. By default the bot will join room "Denshi" with the nick "DenshiBot"

## Notes

Foundation for a Python Synchtube bot. Probably won't develop it further, but feel free to use it as a basis to develop your own.

The bot seems to have a problem remaining connected, so you'll have a bit of debugging work cut for you. The bot will probably be really wonky if it is not a moderator. Patches welcome ;)
